I created a simple sign-up form to demonstrate my skills in HTML and CSS such as:

- Creating forms in HTML and styling them using CSS;
- Utilizing various CSS features such as child combinators, pseudo elements and
classes, CSS functions, and flexbox;
- Use of min() function in CSS to achieve a more responsive design;
- Use of JavaScript to validate certain form fields.
